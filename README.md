# Premier-League Data Visualization using Tableau

In this project, it is decided to redesign a table. So, official Premier League website is chosen as main source of data. This website contains various statistics of different seasons and all the teams which participated in those seasons. There are multiple ways to depict the data. The following scenarios are chosen to analyze the data:
1. Multiple teams in a single season
2. Single team in multiple seasons
